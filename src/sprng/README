This directory contains the scalable pseudo random number generator
library (SPRNG) version 2.0.  It is distributed freely from
http://sprng.cs.fsu.edu/.  We include a version here that has been
modified to be compatible with the Loci configuration system.
Otherwise the files are the same as the 2.0b version of SPRNG.  To use
the parallel random numbers call Loci::random() or Loci::irandom().
