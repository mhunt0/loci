This directory contains one entry in addition to this readme:

  teciosrc                   Contains the source code to build the
                             Tecio static library

Note: the static library has been pre-built, but if it does not run or link
on your system, you should rebuild it.

Please see the readme in the teciosrc directory for
information on how to build the library.

The source code contained in this package is redistributable. Please see
tecio_license_agreement.txt in teciosrc for more information.
