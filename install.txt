PRELIMINARIES:


Before you install Loci you will need to make sure that the following
packages are installed on your system:

mpi:  Message passing interface.  This will usually be installed on most
      computational clusters.  Loci should be able to work with most versions
      of mpi, but if one is not installed, the open-mpi is recommended for
      use with Loci and is available from http://www.open-mpi.org/

hdf5: Library that supports a portable file format for scientific data.  Loci 
      uses this library to read and write data files.  This can be obtained
      from http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/

Optional packages:

PETSc: A package that allows Loci to use preconditioned Krylov
       subspace solvers for solving large sparse linear systems.  
       Available from http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/

libxml2: A library for parsing XML formatted input files.  This
         library is used to define geometric region adaptation 
         for the mesh adaptation tool.  If the library is not found, 
         this feature is disabled.  Most systems will have the libxml2 
         library installed as part of the operating system.  If it is 
         not installed, the library can be obtained from 
         http://xmlsoft.org/index.html

Notes on compiling these packages are provided at the end of this file.

How to compile and install the Loci libraries:

Once you have installed the required libraries (including adding the
appropriate paths to your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variables), select a directory that you wish to install the Loci
libraries.  You can then configure and install Loci using the
following commands:

./configure --prefix=<install_directory>
make
make install

This will compile and install Loci in the directory
<install_directory>/Loci-*.  If there are any problems with compilation you
may need to edit the files OBJ/sys.conf (system configuration file) or
OBJ/comp.conf (compiler configuration file) to accomodate variations
on your system that the configure script did not detect. 

To use the Loci library you will need to add the
<install_directory>/Loci-*/bin subdirectory to your PATH environment
and the <install_directory>/Loci-*/lib subdirectory to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment.  Also, you will need to set the LOCI_BASE
environment variable to <install_directory>/Loci-*

Notes on installing packages required by Loci

First:  You do not need to have root privledges to install this
software, you only need to have enough disk space in directories that
you have write permission.

Second:  Most of these packages can be downloaded and installed using
a provided configure script, the typical install process will be

1) Download the software from the provided web pages
2) Read installation instructions on the provided web sites, but
   installation for most of these packages follows the following
   steps:
    a) uncompress (usually gunzip <file.tar.gz>) and unarchive
    (usually tar xvf <file>.tar) the downloaded file
    b) change into the newly created directory formed in step a)
    c) run the configure script (usually this is run with the
       following command)
       
       ./configure --prefix=/install/dir

       Where /install/dir will be replaced with the directory where
       you wish to install the software.  If you are installing it in
       your home directory, you might select "--prefix=~/Software" for 
       example.
       
       To see other options of the ./configure script, usually you can
       use ./configure --help and also read the installation
       instructions provided at the software web site.
    d) Compile the software library, use the command
        
       make

    e) Install the software under the prefix directory

       make install

    f) Add the paths to the binaries and libraries to your PATH and
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH environments.  This is usually done by
       modifying your .bashrc file (bash) or your .cshrc file (csh or
       tcsh).  For the bash shell the commands added to the .bashrc
       file are:
       
       export PATH=/install/dir/bin:$PATH
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/install/dir/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

       For tcsh shellthe commands added to the .cshrc file are:

       setenv PATH /install/dir/bin:$PATH
       setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /install/dir/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

       Note: above substitute the /install/dir with the directory you
       have given in the --prefix during the configuration step.

3)  After making the changes to the .bashrc or .cshrc file, you will
    need to log out and log back in before the libraries are available.
    Alternatively you can enter the above commands directly on the command
    line to temporarily enable access to the libraries.

Notes on installing the PETSC package

You will find that it is more straightforward to use the PETSc package
with Loci if you configure it without the X-Window library features.
Also, the code will run significantly faster if compiled without
debugging options.  A typical install for Loci might use the following
configuration lines

PETSC_DIR=`pwd`
./config/configure.py --prefix=/opt/petsc-2.3.3-p13 --with-clanguage=C --with-precision=double --with-scalar-type=real --with-dynamic --with-debugging=no --with-x=no --with-x11=no --download-f-blas-lapack=ifneeded --with-log=no --COPTFLAGS="-O3"

With PETSc, the usual approach to installation is to untar the
source code directly where you intend to install PETSc and compile
it there.  Then the prefix option to configure is not necessary and
you only need to 'make' the software, you do not need to 'make
install'.  However, to save memory space you may prefer to make the
software in a temporary directory and use 'make install' to install
the main parts of the software that you will use.  If you do this, you
will need to remember to copy the externalpackages directory from
where petsc was compiled to its installation directory.  The PETSc
'make install' command does not do this step.


Thus for the above command, to compile and make, one might issue the commands

make
make install
cp -r externalpackages /opt/petsc-2.3.3-p11
chmod -R a+rX /opt/petsc-2.3.3-p11

(Note, the last command simply adjusts the permissions of the installed 
 software to allow other users to also be able to link to and use the 
 libraries.)

Before configuring Loci, set the PETSC_DIR environment variable to
point to the installed PETSc library, then the configure script will
be able to find and include PETSc in the Loci libraries.
