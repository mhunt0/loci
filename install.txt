How to compile and install the Loci libraries

Execute
./tmpcopy <OBJDIR>
where <OBJDIR> is the directory where the object files will be stored
when compiling.  tmpcopy without any arguments will use /usr/tmp/<userid>

Once this is completed there will be sample configuration files set up in
<OBJDIR>.  These files are called sys.conf and comp.conf.

sys.conf is for setting up where libraries and system utilities are located
comp.conf is for making compiler specific settings.

By default, tmpcopy will copy an example configuration file for your system
into sys.conf and the gcc compiler comp.conf.  Look in src/conf for other
example configuration files.

Edit this file to match your system.

Then to compile enter

make

To install at the INSTALL_PATH directory (in sys.conf) type

make install

After installing, set LOCI_BASE to the INSTALL_PATH directory in the
Makefiles of applications that use Loci
