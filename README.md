# What is Loci
Loci (pronounced low-sigh) is a both a C++ library and a programming framework
specifically designed for developing computational simulations of physical
fields, such as computational fluid dynamics. One advantage the framework
provides is automatic parallelization. Once an application is described within
the Loci framework, the application can be executed in parallel without change,
even though the description within the framework included no explicit parallel
directives. A particular advantage of the programming framework is that it
provides a formal framework for the development of simulation knowledge-bases
using *logic-relational* abstractions. While the approach will probably be
alien to most who begin to use it, the programming model is extremely powerful
and worth the patience required to adjust to a new way of thinking about
programming.


# Installation
Start by navigating to the directory where the Loci repo will be located and
clone it. After this, navigate to the root directory and initialize the
submodules:

```bash
cd $HOME/code
git clone https://github.com/rlfontenot/loci.git
cd loci
git submodule init
```

## Dependencies
**Required:**
* MPI implementation, such as [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)
* [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/)*
* Partitioning library - Either:
    * [PT-Scotch](https://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/)*
* Or:
    * [GKlib](https://github.com/KarypisLab/GKlib)*
    * [METIS](https://github.com/KarypisLab/METIS)*
    * [ParMETIS](https://github.com/KarypisLab/ParMETIS)*

**Optional:**
* [PETSc](https://petsc.org/)*
* [libxml2](https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2)
* [CGNS](https://cgns.github.io/)

*These dependencies are available from within the Loci repository as
submodules. The latest version confirmed to work with the currently
checked-out version of Loci can be obtained via:

```bash
git submodule update ext/${modulename}
```

Follow each package's installation procedure and ensure the resulting binary
and library directories are added to your `$PATH` and `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
environment variables.

## Compiling Loci
Next, execute the `configure` script to setup the build directory and files.
`configure --help` will provide the most common options. If no build directory
is provided as an argument the `OBJ` directory will automatically be created to
store the files created during compilation. The `OBJ` directory will be
referenced as `$LOCI_SRC` in the Makefiles. Below is a set of example commands
to configure and install Loci:

```bash
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/loci --with-mpi=${MPI_DIRECTORY}
make install
```

The result of the above commands will be installed in the user-defined *prefix*
destination directory. This directory should be referenced as `$LOCI_BASE`
when linking and compiling other software built on this Loci framework.

## Configuration Files
The `${LOCI_BASE}` directory will contain three configuration files:
* `Loci.conf` - Used to create the GNU Make compiler flags based on the
  `comp.conf` and `sys.conf`.
* `comp.conf` - (Compiler config) Used to create compiler specific flags
  (i.e. gcc, icc, etc.) that are compatible with Loci during the build process.
* `sys.conf` - (System config) Create by the `configure` script that will
  automatically find the needed libraries and executables from the user's
  `$PATH` and `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables.

## For Developers
When working on different components/models within Loci, all of the different
libraries and executables can be compiled from the root directory. Below is a
table that describes the theme for the `Makefiles` that are consistent for each
library/executable:

| Command                       | Description                                                  |
| -----------                   | -----------                                                  |
| `make <target>`               | Compile the target                                           |
| `make install_<target>`       | Copy files to `$LOCI_BASE`                                   |
| `make clean_install_<target>` | Remove files from `$LOCI_BASE`                               |
| `make clean_<target>`         | Remove object, binary, and shared lib files from `$LOCI_SRC` |
| `make distclean_<target>`     | Remove object, binary, shared lib, and dependency files from `$LOCI_SRC` |
| `make spotless_<target>`      | Remove everything from `$LOCI_SRC` and `$LOCI_BASE`          |
| `make devhelp`                | Display environment/compilation variables                    |
